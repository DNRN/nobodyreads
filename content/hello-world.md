So I made a blog. Nobody will read it — that's kind of the point. If you're here anyway, welcome. Pull up a chair.

This is a space for things I think about while staring at a terminal or wandering through the woods. Sometimes those overlap more than you'd expect.

## What to expect

Posts will probably fall into a few loose buckets:

**Code.** Mostly notes-to-self about things I've learned, broken, or fixed. Languages, tools, patterns — whatever I'm working with at the time. Like [[mycelium-and-microservices|this one about distributed systems and fungi]].

**Mushrooms.** Identification, foraging, ecology. The kind of stuff that makes you look twice at a rotting log. See [[chanterelles-and-clean-code]] for a taste.

**Everything else.** Cooking, books, half-formed opinions. The in-between stuff.

> "The best time to start a blog is ten years ago. The second best time is when nobody's watching."

Here's a snippet to prove this is a programming blog:

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("hello, world");
  console.log("nobody reads this");
}

greet();
```

That's it for now. More soon — or not. We'll see.
