  What foraging for chanterelles taught me about refactoring.
  Both require patience, pattern recognition, and knowing when to stop.

Last fall I spent a morning foraging for chanterelles in a patch of old-growth forest. I came home with a basket of golden mushrooms and a nagging thought about refactoring.

Both activities share a strange rhythm: you scan, you recognize a pattern, you decide whether to act. And in both cases, the biggest mistake is not knowing when to stop.

## Pattern recognition

When you're looking for chanterelles, you learn to see the forest differently. The color of the soil matters. The type of trees. The way light falls on the mossy ground. After a while, your brain starts pattern-matching before your conscious mind catches up.

Refactoring code is the same. You develop an eye for duplication, for awkward abstractions, for functions that are doing too much. The patterns reveal themselves once you've trained your attention.

## When to stop

The hardest part of foraging isn't finding mushrooms — it's leaving some behind. You need to let the mycelium keep doing its thing.

Same with refactoring. The code doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be good enough that the next person (probably you in six months) can understand it. Over-refactoring is just as harmful as not refactoring at all.

Know when to put the basket down.
