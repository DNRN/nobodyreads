    About Dennis — a software engineer who writes about code, fungi,
    and the odd tangent that connects the two.
---

Hi. I'm Dennis. I write code and look at mushrooms. Sometimes
at the same time, but that's usually a mistake.

This blog is a place to put thoughts that don't fit in a commit
message. Expect posts about software, fungi, and the odd tangent
that connects the two.

The site is intentionally simple — static HTML, a bit of CSS,
no frameworks, no trackers, no cookies. Just words on a page.

If you want to reach me, you probably already know how.
